    >
        Gaining greater control over data security, privacy, and regulatory compliance.
        <li>Meeting regulatory requirements (e.g., local UAE regulatory compliance) is primary may demand that data is stored within specific geographical locations or infrastructure under your control.</li>
    </Card>
    <Card
        title='Data Ownership and Control'
        icon='database'
    >
        Maintaining complete ownership of all observability data.
        <li>Should gives us ability to manage data, retention policies, and access and privacy. And implementation of end to end data life cycle.</li>
    </Card>

    >
        Addressing customer concerns regarding data privacy and security.

        <li>Should be able to achieve/address customer expectations and their concerns in keeping their data secure and maintaining data privacy.</li>

        Shifting from an OPEX to a CAPEX model for observability infrastructure as the subscription based models costs high due to high with volume of logs,application data streams.
        <li> Unlike the subscription based models like datadog, A self-hosted ELK stack shifts the cost model from OPEX to CAPEX (capital expenditure) for infrastructure, offering potential long-term cost savings, especially with substantial data volumes. This decision implies an investment in internal expertise for managing the ELK stack.</li>
    </Card>
    <Card
        title='Avoiding Vendor/data Lock-in'
        icon='lock'
    >
        Gaining flexibility in choosing observability tools and technologies.
        <br/>
        <li>It allows us with the freedom to own and manage out own data life cycle, customize the stack, integrate with other open-source tools, and switch vendors if needed.</li>
