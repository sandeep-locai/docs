## Current Features
<ul>
    <li><b>Logs:</b> Time-stamped records of discrete events. Logs provide detailed context and are essential for  debugging and troubleshooting. Examples include application logs, system logs, and audit logs.</li>
    <li><b>Metrics:</b> Numerical measurements of system behavior over time. Metrics provide aggregated data and are useful for identifying trends and anomalies. Examples include CPU usage, memory consumption, request latency, and error rates.</li>
    <li><b>RUM:</b>Realtime User Experience -  tracks and analyzes the behavior and experiences of users interacting with a website or application in real time. Tracks user journey tracking, performance metrics, geographical, browser and device level analysis.</li>
</ul>
